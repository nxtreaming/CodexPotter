# codex-potter TUI

## Overview

This `tui/` crate is expected to match upstream Codex CLI TUI behavior and styles as closely as possible,
so that users switching between codex and codex-potter have a consistent experience.

Unless explicitly documented below, changes should preserve parity.

## Explicit Divergences

Content below lists explicit divergences in codex-potter's TUI compared to upstream codex's TUI.

When introducing new changes, first identify whether it is a divergence from upstream or it makes the code more aligned with upstream.
Divergences must be documented in places below to avoid regression when syncing changes from upstream:

- Record divergences in this file, keep words concise but clear, be specific about the new behavior.
- Record divergences in doc comments.
- Cover divergences via proper tests (unit / end to end).

### New Features

**Transcript verbosity**, see `docs/spec/verbosity.md`. Related with:
- transcript/output policy
- verbosity (`minimal` / `simple`) mode selection
- transcript item rendering, like `Ran` / `Explored` / `Searched` / `Viewed Image` / plan / change,
  commentary status, timing separators, etc
- `codex-potter exec` human-readable output

**Project list**, see `docs/spec/project_list.md`. Related with:
- `Ctrl+L`, `/list` feature
- resume picker

### Text Box

- Supports `$` skills picker, the same as upstream.
- Slash command picker exists but only supports `/mention`, `/list`, `/theme`, `/verbosity`, `/yolo`, `/compact-kb` (inserts a canned KB cleanup prompt), `/ps`, `/stop`, `/exit`, `/potter:xmodel` (inserts a literal marker only).
- No `?` shortcuts overlay (treat `?` as a literal character).
- `Tab` inserts a literal tab character (`\t`) into the composer.
- Composer placeholder text is customized.
- No Esc-driven rewind/backtrack UX; `Esc` interrupts running project and otherwise dismisses popups.
- No steer mode (always queue).
- Hardens non-bracketed paste bursts against delayed trailing `Enter` key events: after a burst flush, keep Enter suppression alive briefly so they insert a newline instead of submit/queue.
- Uses a slightly longer non-Windows paste-burst idle timeout (16ms) to avoid splitting large pastes under scheduler jitter.
- No image pasting support.
- Bottom pane prompt footer shows the ctrl+g editor hint first, then the optional git branch + working dir (`<branch> ❯ <dir>`). When YOLO is active, it prefixes the footer with a red bold `▲YOLO`.
- Better word jump by using ICU4X word segmentation, plus grouping consecutive identical ASCII separators as a single segment (e.g. `====` one jump; `+-` splits).
- Prompt history is persisted under `~/.codexpotter/history.jsonl`.

### Message Items

- Additional codex-potter items (e.g. project creation hints, stream recovery retries, project-finished summary on success / budget exhaustion).
- Hook status output uses protocol kebab-case event labels (for example `session-start`) to match
  exec output and hook run identifiers.

### Shimmer

- Round prefix is added to shimmer lines.
- Round prefix includes a dim total elapsed timer since the current project started.
- Remaining context window is moved into the shimmer area.
- No `esc to interrupt` message (even though `Esc` interrupts running tasks).

### Other differences

Behavior related

- A customized banner on startup; the first-screen model label appends `[fast]` when layered Codex config resolves `service_tier = "fast"` and `features.fast_mode` remains enabled
- Home-relative `CODEX_HOME` values are expanded before resolving TUI config, themes, and skill roots (including Windows-native `~\...`)
- Additionally shows gitignore startup hint
- When a frame does not request a cursor position, hide the cursor before flushing frame diffs to avoid visible cursor movement (the cursor may be visible in the previous frame).
- Startup onboarding prompts:
  - Suggest adding `.codexpotter/` to the global gitignore.
  - If no `[tui].verbosity` is configured yet, prompt for a default verbosity level.
  - When both prompts are shown, they render `Setup 1/2` and `Setup 2/2` markers.
- Multi-agent collab is transcript-only: no agent thread picker UI (no per-agent transcript view).
- Auto retry on errors (successful recoveries are transient-only; unrecoverable errors are surfaced).
- Customized update notification / self-update (and on-disk state under `~/.codexpotter/`).
- No desktop notifications when the terminal is unfocused.
- Esc triggers project interrupt with an action selection UI instead of turn interrupt.
- Project summary `Loop more rounds:` resume command includes the current process's non-default `codex-potter` global flags (aligns with the CLI exit resume note).

Engineering related:

- Unneeded logics and codes in codex TUI are intentionally removed to keep code tidy and focus (codex-potter's TUI is a _subset_ of codex's TUI):
  - `?` shortcuts overlay, /model selection, most slash commands
  - Rewind (esc)
  - Approval flows
  - Other interactive features not needed
  - Unneeded codes, tests and snapshots
- codex-potter explicitly forbids `pub(crate)` visibility in TUI code; only `pub` and private items are allowed.
- `bottom_pane::textarea::TextArea` keeps atomic text elements as anonymous ranges only; upstream named-element helpers stay removed until codex-potter needs those flows.
- codex-potter does not use Bazel.

### Upstream Bug Fixes

These fix upstream bugs. Prefer upstreaming or removing them once upstream has equivalent behavior.

- Keyboard enhancement flags intentionally omit `REPORT_EVENT_TYPES`. Upstream currently requests
  release/repeat events, which can leak raw CSI-u key-release bytes into the shell after `Ctrl+C`
  exits.
- `custom_terminal::Terminal::clear()` clears only the current viewport rows. Upstream currently
  uses `ClearType::AfterCursor`, which can erase committed inline history outside the live viewport
  during prompt transitions or exit cleanup.

## Conventions

- TUI should stay a pure UI module: business logic, filesystem access, and project-specific data loading belong outside `tui/`.
- Default rule: transcript rendering and long-lived task state should still be driven by `EventMsg` / upstream protocol events so upstream parity stays straightforward.
- Exception: TUI-owned popup state machines that are generic UI affordances may be driven by a narrow request/response provider instead of new protocol `Op` / `EventMsg` variants when that keeps protocol semantics cleaner. `projects overlay` is the canonical example:
  - TUI owns the popup state machine and key routing (`tui/src/app_server_render.rs`, `tui/src/projects_overlay.rs`).
  - CLI/workflow owns discovery + detail loading via `ProjectsOverlayProviderChannels` (`tui/src/potter_tui.rs`, `cli/src/workflow/projects_overlay_backend.rs`).
  - Do not move this popup back into protocol-only driver messages unless the popup stops being a TUI concern.

- Test: Always use snapshot tests (without ASCII escape sequences) for TUI rendering tests, so that it is visually clear what the output looks like, unless the test or code comes from upstream codex where non-snapshot tests are used, in which case you must preserve parity.

- IMPORTANT: Isolate divergent code paths: Prefer to use a new file to isolate changed logic from upstream codex, and keep the original file as a subset of the upstream's file, if the changed logic is significant. In this way, we can easily learn what has changed from upstream, and reduce merge conflicts when syncing from upstream.

## TUI Style conventions

See `styles.md`.

## TUI code conventions

- Use concise styling helpers from ratatui’s Stylize trait.
  - Basic spans: use "text".into()
  - Styled spans: use "text".red(), "text".green(), "text".magenta(), "text".dim(), etc.
  - Prefer these over constructing styles with `Span::styled` and `Style` directly.
  - Example: patch summary file lines
    - Desired: vec!["  └ ".into(), "M".red(), " ".dim(), "tui/src/app.rs".dim()]

### TUI Styling (ratatui)

- Prefer Stylize helpers: use "text".dim(), .bold(), .cyan(), .italic(), .underlined() instead of manual Style where possible.
- Prefer simple conversions: use "text".into() for spans and vec![…].into() for lines; when inference is ambiguous (e.g., Paragraph::new/Cell::from), use Line::from(spans) or Span::from(text).
- Computed styles: if the Style is computed at runtime, using `Span::styled` is OK (`Span::from(text).set_style(style)` is also acceptable).
- Avoid hardcoded white: do not use `.white()`; prefer the default foreground (no color).
- Chaining: combine helpers by chaining for readability (e.g., url.cyan().underlined()).
- Single items: prefer "text".into(); use Line::from(text) or Span::from(text) only when the target type isn’t obvious from context, or when using .into() would require extra type annotations.
- Building lines: use vec![…].into() to construct a Line when the target type is obvious and no extra type annotations are needed; otherwise use Line::from(vec![…]).
- Avoid churn: don’t refactor between equivalent forms (Span::styled ↔ set_style, Line::from ↔ .into()) without a clear readability or functional gain; follow file‑local conventions and do not introduce type annotations solely to satisfy .into().
- Compactness: prefer the form that stays on one line after rustfmt; if only one of Line::from(vec![…]) or vec![…].into() avoids wrapping, choose that. If both wrap, pick the one with fewer wrapped lines.

### Text wrapping

- Always use textwrap::wrap to wrap plain strings.
- If you have a ratatui Line and you want to wrap it, use the helpers in tui/src/wrapping.rs, e.g. word_wrap_lines / word_wrap_line.
- If you need to indent wrapped lines, use the initial_indent / subsequent_indent options from RtOptions if you can, rather than writing custom logic.
- If you have a list of lines and you need to prefix them all with some prefix (optionally different on the first vs subsequent lines), use the `prefix_lines` helper from line_utils.
